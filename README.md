## Branch: "Automatidata Project"

_Project Scenario:_ 
> You are a newly-hired data professional at Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm. Automatidataâ€™s focus is to help clients transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions. In this scenario, you will consult with The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission to develop an app that will help users (TLC riders) estimate their taxi fares before their ride. Your first responsibility as a data analytics consultant will be to structure the necessary tasks into a project proposal that establishes milestones for the ride fare data project.

This branch contains several files from the project developed in the course. It includes documents on PACE questions, Jupyter Notebooks in PDF format, and executive summaries from each step of the project. Below is a brief summary of the goal for each course:

**Course 1:** This course includes a file called "Automatidata" which explains the project, and other files detailing project milestones.\
**Course 2:** This involved a preliminary inspection of the data to identify useful features for model creation.\
**Course 3:** I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to determine which variables would be important for building the proper model. A quick Linear Regression Model was also created to analyze the raw data.\
**Course 4:** I conducted A/B testing to experiment with whether users paying by credit card would have higher transaction amounts.\
**Course 5:** Finally, the model was developed using linear regression and feature engineering.\
**Course 6:** Another objective was to identify clients who would tip higher, for which a machine learning model (decision tree and random forest) was created
